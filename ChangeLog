	LOG stuff causses some troubles: when  packing  of  logfile  is  started  while
logging message about reading socket from LRVM, we're  caucghing  CR  because  of
timeout answering from LRVM. I  move  packing  stuff  to  separated  thread,  but
copying of ogfile is still stopping logging stuff. Anyway, it became not so  bad.
I'll try to fix bugs with logging and testlib.pas soon.

	I'm expecting RC2 tonight =)

	Hm.. I looked towards trouble in testlib.pas. It is good. Maybe there  was  not
latest version of compiled binaries at school olympiad?

	There is nothing more beautiful with fixing bug in logging stuff, than up  some
configurations. Sure, it is not bad at all.

dot in name.

2007-10-09  Sergey Sharybin <sharybin@nm.ru>

	Is it time to start code cleanup? And one more difficult question: is  it  time
to realise WebTester Server 5.0.0 or it  would  be  better  to  realise  RC1  and
contunue working towards perfect release?

	Well, on Sunday 14th of October we'll see.
